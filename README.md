# xDrip+ CareLink Follower
> Experimental Medtronic CareLink Follower data source for xDrip+

Medtronic CareLink Follower data source for xDrip+ to retrieve data from Medtronic CareLink of online CGM and insulin pump device data uploads (Guardian Connect, MiniMed 7xxG) inside and outside of US. Originally it was started as a Medtronic Guardian Connect data source for xDrip+ as an alternative for the Nightscout MiniMed Connect, because Medtronic started to block requests from Heroku. Later it turned out that the core Nightscout MiniMed Connect logic can be also used for 7xxG pumps with some modifications based on the US online CareLink Connect webapp (770G is still working). The US data retrieval logic was also working outside the US with the 780G pumps too, although the online CareLink Connect webapp outside US doesn't support the new generation pumps. Finally the code was extended to handle the 7xxG devices too both inside and outside the US.

I have created a separate repository containing only the communication
with CareLink:
[CareLinkJavaClient](https://github.com/benceszasz/CareLinkJavaClient)

## Status
The development is currently in a **very early stage!**

## Supported devices
- Medtronic Guardian Connect CGM
- Medtronic MiniMed 770G pump
- Medtronic MiniMed 780G pump
- Other Medtronic MiniMed 7xxG pumps ???

## Features
Download data from CareLink:
- SG readings
- Insulin treatments (bolus and auto correction)
- Meals
- Finger BGs
- Notifications
- Sensor status information (next calibration, remain lifetime)
- Pump status information (IOB, reservoir, battery) 

Upload data to Nightscout using xDrip built-in Nightscout Sync feature:
- SG readings
- Insulin treatments (bolus and auto correction)
- Meals
- Finger BGs
- Notifications
 
## Limitations
- **CareLink MFA is not supported!!!**
- Nofitication texts are currently always in English


## Requirements
- Suitable CareLink account **with MFA DISABLED**:
    - Guardian Connect CGM outside US: patient or care partner account
    - Guardian Connect CGM inside US: **not tested yet!** (possibly a care partner account)
    - 7xxG pump outside US: care partner account (same as for Medtronic CareLink Connect app)
  -   7xxG pump inside US: care partner account (same as for Medtronic
      CareLink Connect app)

## How to use it
- Download and install
  [latest release](https://github.com/benceszasz/xDripCareLinkFollower/releases)
- Configure CareLink Follower:
  - Select CareLink Follower for data source
  - Set CareLink username, password and country
  - Select required data types: Finger BGs, Boluses, Meals,
    Notifications
  - If needed change grace period (wait after last sensor + 5 mins)
  - If needed change missed data polling interval (polling interval if
    data is not received after last sensor + 5 mins + grace period)
- Additional options:
  - Display pump status info (Settings > Less common settings > Extra
    status line > Pump Status)
  - Display sensor status info (Settings > Less common settings > Extra
    status line > External Status)
- If needed configure upload to Nightscout (Settings > Cloud
  Upload > Nightscout Sync), but **disable download data!**

## Credits
- CareLink data download core logic is based on the
  [Nightscout MiniMed Connect to Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/minimed-connect-to-nightscout)
- Follower data source logic is based on [xDrip+ Nightscout and DexShare
follower data sources](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip)
